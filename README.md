# Snake Game with Apple 🐍🍎

## 📌 Description
This project is a classic **Snake Game** implemented in **C++** using **OpenGL**, developed as part of a Computer Graphics course.  
The concept is simple: you control a snake that moves around the screen, eating apples to grow longer.  

⚠️ Rules:
- If the snake hits the wall → Game Over.
- If the snake collides with itself → Game Over.

The code is modular and can be modified to suit your needs or extended with new features.

## 🎮 Features
- Implemented with **OpenGL** to demonstrate computer graphics concepts.
- Snake grows longer with each apple eaten.
- Increasing difficulty as the game progresses.
- Clean and adaptable code for learning and experimentation.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/snake-opengl.git
